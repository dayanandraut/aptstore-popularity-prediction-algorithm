Implementation of popularity prediction algorithm for aptstore: dynamic storage management for hadoop

I have implemented the Popularity Prediction algorithm (PPA) (proposed in the paper mentioned in the reference) in python. I have uploaded the source code in plain python file and in a Jupyter notebook which has all the simulated data and the results. Finally, I have displayed the results in bar graph for better visualization.

If any issue is found in my implementation, please let me know. Thanks for reading.
